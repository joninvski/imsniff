TODO
----

Not sure I will do all (or any) of this list, as the program is working 
fairly well for my needs.

- Delete old entries in the conversation linked list, so memory usage
  doesn't grow forever (there are times where a switchboard can be 
  closed with no warning, so we need to have our own timeout).
- Improve documentation.
- Some parts of the protocol are being ignored because I don't absolutely
  need them, however keeping track of XFR's (and possibly others) would be 
  useful.
- Fix bugs.
- Rewrite capture loop.
- Deal with packets arriving out of order.
- Capture file transfers.
