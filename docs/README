IMsnif, by Carlos Fernandez, carlos.fernandez.sanz@gmail.com
------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
-----------
IMsnif is a simple program to log Instant Message activity 
on the network. It uses libpcap to capture packets and 
analyzes them, logging conversation, contact lists, etc.

RUNNING (LINUX)
---------------
You can configure it via command line parameters or via a
file called imsniff.conf either in the current directory
or in /etc. If for some reason you rename the IMsniff 
execute, you need to rename the config file as well.
A sample imsniff.conf.sample file is included.

The only required parameter is the interface name to listen
to. This can be any interface that libpcap supports, such
as

imsnif eth0

If you use a non-ethernet interface, please read the data 
offset section below.

For users connecting after IMsnif starts running you can get
pretty good results, including complete contact lists and 
events (display name change, for example). For users already
connected you will be able to get the conversations, which is
not bad, but you will miss other stuff.

OTHER PARAMETERS
----------------
command line       config file       Description
------------------------------------------------------------
-cd                chatdir           Directory where conversations
                                     will be stored.
-dd                debugdir          Directory where logs will be
                                     stored. These logs contain
				     debug information as well 
				     as certain MSN events. 
-v*                verbose           Debug level. The more v's
                                     (or higher the number in the
				     config file), the more info
				     that is dumped. For regular
				     usage, use 1 or 2. More than
				     that will dump a lot of useless
				     stuff.
-p                 promisc           Put the device in promiscuous
                                     mode.
-d                 daemonize         Become a daemon.
-offset            data_offset       See below.
-help              N/A               Display help.
With no prefix     interface         Interface to use.

DATA OFFSET
-----------
The offset (in this context) is the length of the datalink header
when capturing packets. This is an important number because we 
need to skip this header when processing packets. For ethernet,
this number is 14, and IMsniff knows about it. If you use a different
interface, you might have to help IMsniff by providing the number
yourself. Por example:

imniff ppp0 -offset 4

How do you figure out this number? The easiest way is just try 
different numbers (and keep your own MSN connection busy (type something)
until IMsniff starts dumping conversations. The number is never high
anyway. A few tries should always do.

If you have to use this, once it's working please drop me a note telling
me what interface type IMsnif reported, and the offset you used. I will
add this to the code so next versions don't have to be tuned manually.

RUNNING (WINDOWS)
-----------------
Everything is like linux, except:

- Instead of a device NAME you need to enter a device NUMBER. This is
  because device names in Windows are pretty much unreadable. In order
  to get the number, run the program with -list just once, i.e.

  imsniff -list

  You will get a list of available devices, with a number, a name (you
  will see why we don't want to use this), and a description. Just 
  choose the correct number, and use it, like this:

  imsniff 2

- There is no deaemon mode. If someone bothers to make imsniff a service,
  please send me the patches. In the meantime, it's just console mode.

STATUS
------
Beta version. Seems to work decently.

SUPPORTED PROTOCOLS
-------------------
For now, only MSN. Others could follow.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
libpcab or winpcap.
